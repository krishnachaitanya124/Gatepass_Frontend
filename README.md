# Gatepass_Frontend
# 🧾 Fingerprint-Based Out Pass Generation System

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

## 📌 Abstract

This project addresses the inefficiencies in hostel leave management by developing a scalable biometric-based pass issuance system using fingerprint authentication. It supports both long-term “Pink Pass” and short-term “Outpass” requests.

Key features include:

- 🔒 **Fingerprint-based biometric authentication**
- 📧 **Email-based pass delivery**
- 📱 **SMS notification to registered parents**
- 🔄 **Real-time pass issuance interface using React.js**
- 🌐 **Multi-admin backend built with Node.js and Express.js**
- ☁️ **Cloud-hosted MySQL database for fast retrieval**

With a user-friendly design, this system minimizes manual errors, improves security, enhances transparency, and ensures efficient operation even during peak hostel exit hours.
